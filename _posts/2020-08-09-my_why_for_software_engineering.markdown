<p> Life sometimes gives you a journey that you'd never expect.  Before I explain why I chose to dive into programming, I have to explain what led me towards it.  Oddly enough, I absolutely believed I would never  be able to code in the first place.  I was passionate in Kinesiology (exercise science) and wanted to become either an athletic trainer or  physical therapist.  In otherwords, I embedded myself in athletics and exercise.  Unfortunately, life happened, which eventually led to depression and burnout.  With that said, my path related towards my future seemed so foggy when I slowly phased myself out of kinesiology.  I really didnt know what I wanted to do.</p>  

<p>Eventually my friend suggested to try coding.  For a person that had no real direction, I tried out some of the lessons just to try it out.  To my surprise, I actually enjoyed what was being taught in these lessons and I was ecstatic to find something that I enjoy and a possible route to pursue.  At the same time, I was inspired by charities concerning global problems and domestic problems to maybe make an app that help support these causes.  But, to make an app I knew i needed to acquire skills and knowledge on how to make an effective app that may or may not help spread awareness or support causes to problems that exist. And that's why I'm here, studying Software engineering at the Flatiron School to hopefully be a part of something bigger than myself.  And who knows, maybe I'll come back to Health someday, but for now, this is what i want.</p>
